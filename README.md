# catClicker
Part of a Udacity's Front-end Nanodegree Program. In this project main focus is scalability and Refactoring in a way that different concerns are separated.
In the first version just some simple interaction was required and in the final version an "Admin mode" was added so that data regarding to the selected cat would be changable.
All done with Vanilla JS and Jquery.
